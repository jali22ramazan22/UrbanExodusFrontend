The frontend work will be split into three stages:

Work to proceed: 
- 1st level - the level that provides the correct work of its concept. The base, fundament of it. - DONE âœ”
- 2nd level - the level that provides some bonuses, features, instrument to ease the game experience
- 3rd level - the level that also provides some bonuses, mini-games involving the key instruments affecting of game atmosphere.
The interesting concept was injected into that levels. The main task is to maintain the logical improvement of every aspect of its functionality. To be concrete: Online-Market, Network, Map, Software, Personal, System Interface (Anonymous users that will be as a system interaction to a user aka player)
